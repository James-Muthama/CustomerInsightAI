# Customer Insight AI
**Automated Understanding of Customer Feedback Using AI**

## Project Overview
CustomerInsightAI is a project aimed at automating the understanding of customer feedback by converting customer care conversations into text. The system leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and categorize customer interactions based on predetermined categories set for the AI model. This tool is designed to enhance customer service operations by providing deeper insights into customer sentiments and concerns, helping businesses improve their customer care strategies effectively.

## Project Components

1. **Speech to Text Conversion**: The project includes functionality to convert speech from customer care conversations into text using OpenAI's Whisper model for speech recognition.
2. **AI-based Categorization**: The converted text is then processed by an AI model to understand and categorize the content based on predefined categories.

## Usage
The primary goal of CustomerInsightAI is to streamline the analysis of customer feedback, providing valuable insights into customer sentiments and concerns. This can be particularly useful in the data observability of customer care calls.

## Dataset Used
The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bitext/training-dataset-for-chatbotsvirtual-assistants).
